## Welcome to A HTML Template Guide

You can download our templates and use them to make your own stylish HTML files and upload them to the internet all by yourself!

Reminder, this does use a combination of regular CSS-3 and Bootstrap. **We dont use bootstrap for JS as of yet**

### Current Templates
All we have right now is the sign up/login template which you can view below. 

### We use bootstrap
Currently, we do use bootstrap for CSS but **not** for JS **yet**.
Use the following code in your `<head>` tags. It **must** be above any other style sheets that are linked to your project.
```markdown
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-1BmE4kWBq78iYhFldvKuhfTAU6auU8tT94WrHftjDbrCEXSU1oBoqyl2QvZ6jIW3" crossorigin="anonymous">
```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/wuterbutl/templates/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
